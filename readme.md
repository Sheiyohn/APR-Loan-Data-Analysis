# (Prosper Loan Investigation)
## by (Sheiyohn Arunthavanathan)

## Dataset

The data consists of information 113,066 entries on unique loan listing for Prosper Loans. 
The data set has about 82 variables describing each feature of the loan, the borrower and the investor.


## Summary of Findings

In the exploration, I identified that a strong linear inverse relationship between the
borrowers income range and the assigned APR for his listing. With the increase income range, 
the borrower's APR shows a reduction. However, i found suprisingly that borrowers in the 
income range of USD1-25,999 tend to see a higher APR compared to unemployed people and 
people with unverified incomes (especially compared to those said to be earning more than USD 
75,000). Additionally when carrying out a time series analysis across Borrowers APR and the average
loan amount across each year, there has been very few listing made in the year 2008-2009. 
This can be due to fact of the Global Recession of 2008.

Outside this, I investigates the possible demographics on details of these Borrowers, such as 
their occupation, the reason for taking out loans and what state of USA they originate from.
